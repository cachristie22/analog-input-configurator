Its built-in 4G LTE connectivity to the RemoteIQ Cloud eliminates the need for third-party networking hardware, external modems, or software licensing.",

Intuitive graphics and dashboards within RemoteIQ Water provide live insights into site performance, enabling quick decisions and proactive maintenance.",

The unit includes an 18-hour onboard backup battery, with an option to extend runtime up to 72 hours. When AC power is lost, the controller automatically switches to battery operation and maintains output power for critical sensor loops, ensuring continuous monitoring and alarm capability."
